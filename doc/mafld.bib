   abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most common chronic liver disease worldwide with a reported prevalence ranging 20-30% depending on the studied populations. The high prevalence of NAFLD is probably due to the contemporary epidemics of obesity, unhealthy dietary pattern, and sedentary lifestyle. NAFLD patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular and liver related mortality. The cornerstone of any treatment regimen for patients with NAFLD is lifestyle modification focused on weight loss, exercise, and improving insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this review is to outline the effect of diet and lifestyle factors on developing NAFLD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regular consumption of diets with increased protein or fibre intakes may benefit body weight and composition and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Lupin flour is a novel food ingredient high in protein and fibre. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a lupin-enriched diet, during and following energy restriction, on body weight and composition and cardiovascular disease risk factors in overweight individuals. DESIGN: Participants (n = 131) were recruited to a 12-month parallel-design trial. They were randomly assigned to consume lupin-enriched foods or matching high-carbohydrate control foods. All participants underwent 3 months of weight loss, 1 month of weight stabilization and 8 months of weight maintenance. Body weight and composition and cardiovascular disease risk factors were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 months. RESULTS: Lupin, relative to control, did not significantly influence (mean difference (95% CI)) weight loss at 4 months (0.1 kg (-1.2, 1.4)) and 12 months (-0.6 kg (-2.0, 0.8)), maintenance of weight loss from 4 to 12 months (-0.7 kg (-1.83, 0.48)) or measures of body fat and fat-free mass. Relative to control, 24-h ambulatory systolic (-1.3 mm Hg (-2.4, -0.3), P = 0.016) and diastolic (-1.0 mm Hg (-1.9, -0.2), P = 0.021) blood pressures were lower at 12 months but not at 4 months; fasting insulin concentrations and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) scores were significantly lower at 4 months (-1.2 mU l(-1) (-1.3, -1.1), P = 0.004 and -0.6 units (-1.0, -0.19), P = 0.004) and 12 months (-1.3 mU l(-1) (-1.4, -1.1), P < 0.001 and -0.7 units (-1.1, -0.24), P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A diet higher in protein and fibre derived from lupin-enriched foods does not enhance weight loss or improve the maintenance of weight loss. However, such a diet may provide cardiovascular health benefits in terms of insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.},

   abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses the simple steatosis to more progressive steatosis with associated hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in some cases hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is a growing epidemic, not only in the United States, but worldwide in part due to obesity and insulin resistance leading to liver accumulation of triglycerides and free fatty acids. Numerous risk factors for the development of NAFLD have been espoused with most having some form of metabolic derangement or insulin resistance at the core of its pathophysiology. NAFLD patients are at increased risk of liver-related as well as cardiovascular mortality, and NAFLD is rapidly becoming the leading indication for liver transplantation. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, but the development of noninvasive advanced imaging, biochemical and genetic tests will no doubt provide future clinicians with a great deal of information and opportunity for enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis and targeted treatment. As it currently stands several medications/supplements are being used in the treatment of NAFLD; however, none seem to be the "magic bullet" in curtailing this growing problem yet. In this review we summarized the current knowledge of NAFLD epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, pathogenesis, pathologic changes, natural history, and treatment in order to aid in further understanding this disease and better managing NAFLD patients.},

   abstract = {Legumes (including alfalfa, clover, lupins, green beans and peas, peanuts, soybeans, dry beans, broad beans, dry peas, chickpeas, and lentils) represent an important component of the human diet in several areas of the world, especially in the developing countries, where they complement the lack of proteins from cereals, roots, and tubers. In some regions of the world, legume seeds are the only protein supply in the diet. The health benefits of legume consumption have received rising interest from researchers, and their consumption and production extends worldwide. Among European countries, higher legume consumption is observed around the Mediterranean, with per capita daily consumption between 8 and 23 g, while in Northern Europe, the daily consumption is less than 5 g per capita. The physiological effects of different legumes vary significantly. These differences may result from the polysaccharides composition, in particular, the quantity and variety of dietary fibers and starch, protein make-up, and variability in phytochemical content. The majority of legumes contain phytochemicals: bioactive compounds, including enzyme inhibitors, phytohemagglutinins (lectins), phytoestrogens, oligosaccharides, saponins, and phenolic compounds, which play metabolic roles in humans who frequently consume these foods. Dietary intake of phytochemicals may provide health benefits, protecting against numerous diseases or disorders, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and inflammation. The synergistic or antagonistic effects of these phytochemical mixtures from food legumes, their interaction with other components of the diet, and the mechanism of their action have remained a challenge with regard to understanding the role of phytochemicals in health and diseases. Their mitigating effects and the mechanism of their action need to be further addressed if we are to understand the role of phytochemicals in health and diseases. This review provides an overview of the nutritional quality of legumes and their potential contribution in cardiometabolic risk prevention.},

   abstract = {To detect modest associations of dietary intake with disease risk, observational studies need to be large and control for moderate measurement errors. The reproducibility of dietary intakes of macronutrients, food groups and dietary patterns (vegetarian and Mediterranean) was assessed in adults in the UK Biobank study on up to five occasions using a web-based 24-h dietary assessment (n 211 050), and using short FFQ recorded at baseline (n 502 655) and after 4 years (n 20 346). When the means of two 24-h assessments were used, the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for macronutrients varied from 0·63 for alcohol to 0·36 for polyunsaturated fat. The ICC for food groups also varied from 0·68 for fruit to 0·18 for fish. The ICC for the FFQ varied from 0·66 for meat and fruit to 0·48 for bread and cereals. The reproducibility was higher for vegetarian status (κ > 0·80) than for the Mediterranean dietary pattern (ICC = 0·45). Overall, the reproducibility of pairs of 24-h dietary assessments and single FFQ used in the UK Biobank were comparable with results of previous prospective studies using conventional methods. Analyses of diet-disease relationships need to correct for both measurement error and within-person variability in dietary intake in order to reliably assess any such associations with disease in the UK Biobank.},

   abstract = {The UK Biobank cohort is a population-based cohort of 500,000 participants recruited in the United Kingdom (UK) between 2006 and 2010. Approximately 9.2 million individuals aged 40-69 years who lived within 25 miles (40 km) of one of 22 assessment centers in England, Wales, and Scotland were invited to enter the cohort, and 5.5% participated in the baseline assessment. The representativeness of the UK Biobank cohort was investigated by comparing demographic characteristics between nonresponders and responders. Sociodemographic, physical, lifestyle, and health-related characteristics of the cohort were compared with nationally representative data sources. UK Biobank participants were more likely to be older, to be female, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas than nonparticipants. Compared with the general population, participants were less likely to be obese, to smoke, and to drink alcohol on a daily basis and had fewer self-reported health conditions. At age 70-74 years, rates of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence were 46.2% and 11.8% lower, respectively, in men and 55.5% and 18.1% lower, respectively, in women than in the general population of the same age. UK Biobank is not representative of the sampling population; there is evidence of a "healthy volunteer" selection bias. Nonetheless, valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large.},

   abstract = {The Oxford WebQ is an online 24-hour dietary questionnaire that is appropriate for repeated administration in large-scale prospective studies, including the UK Biobank study and the Million Women Study. We compared the performance of the Oxford WebQ and a traditional interviewer-administered multiple-pass 24-hour dietary recall against biomarkers for protein, potassium, and total sugar intake and total energy expenditure estimated by accelerometry. We recruited 160 participants in London, United Kingdom, between 2014 and 2016 and measured their biomarker levels at 3 nonconsecutive time points. The measurement error model simultaneously compared all 3 methods. Attenuation factors for protein, potassium, total sugar, and total energy intakes estimated as the mean of 2 applications of the Oxford WebQ were 0.37, 0.42, 0.45, and 0.31, respectively, with performance improving incrementally for the mean of more measures. Correlation between the mean value from 2 Oxford WebQs and estimated true intakes, reflecting attenuation when intake is categorized or ranked, was 0.47, 0.39, 0.40, and 0.38, respectively, also improving with repeated administration. These correlations were similar to those of the more administratively burdensome interviewer-based recall. Using objective biomarkers as the standard, the Oxford WebQ performs well across key nutrients in comparison with more administratively burdensome interviewer-based 24-hour recalls. Attenuation improves when the average value is taken over repeated administrations, reducing measurement error bias in assessment of diet-disease associations.},

   abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is characterized by >5% deposition of triglycerides in hepatocytes, is often referred as a major risk factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. We investigated the hepatoprotective effect of whole soybean embryos containing bioactive substances such as isoflavones and soyasaponins. For this study, mice were randomly allocated into four groups that were fed different diets for 10 weeks: normal diets and high-fat and high-cholesterol diets (HD), and HD with 10% or 20% soybean embryo powder (10SE-HD and 20SE-HD). Hepatic superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity of the experimental groups increased during the period of the study (P < .05). Hepatic mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor α, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, and Caspase 3 were decreased when soybean embryos were increased in the mice's diets. Both of the soybean embryo-treated groups showed significantly decreased serum and liver triglyceride and total cholesterol. Adiponectin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, and apolipoprotein B mRNA expressions were decreased in the mice that were fed soybean embryos. We suggest that the regular supplementation of soybean embryos might be a useful treatment for preventing NAFLD and associated complications through upregulation of adiponectin-mediated AMPKα pathway parameters, which are implicated in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid metabolism activities.},

   abstract = {See corresponding article on page 1379.The concept of food substitutions is simple: eating 1 food instead of another. Whereas studying the effects of eating 1 food instead of another is typically explicit in interventional study designs, it is often implicit and sometimes hidden in analyses of observational studies. The substitution in question is often introduced as a consequence of adjusting regression models assessing associations between a food and an outcome of interest for total energy intake, thus restraining the comparison within the model to participants reporting the same energy intake. Willett et al. (1) discussed this in their seminal article, and the methods have been further discussed on theoretical and practical levels in several recent articles (2–4). Although intuition and practical subject matter knowledge are important, no formal simulation studies had been performed to date to investigate the implications of different food substitution modeling approaches. In this issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Tomova et al. (5) fill this gap by investigating several modeling approaches for different food substitutions using simulations with parameters informed by the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey. Of note, the authors investigate substitutions of 1 food instead of another as well as more complex substitutions of 1 food instead of several others. They also investigate the implications of modeling intake as nutrients, or as foods, either in calorie units or in mass units. Some of their findings confirm previous intuitions: we can rest assured. Others may require researchers to revisit how these models are applied in practice: a cause for concern.},

However, the method has not been widely applied in studies of food intake. The aim of this article is to describe and compare the interpretation and application of different food substitution models in epidemiologic studies on diet and disease development. Both theoretically and in the context of a specific example, we discuss methodologic issues to be considered, including modeling of food substitutions using diet at a single time point or at multiple time points (focusing on dietary changes), choice of substitution unit, adjustment for total energy intake, and adjustment for confounding. We argue that specified food substitution analyses can be used to identify optimal food composition of the diet and that these analyses are thus highly relevant to inform public health policy decision makers.},

To quantify the effect of dietary pulse interventions on BP and provide evidence for their inclusion in dietary guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials was conducted. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were each searched from inception through 5 May 2013. Human trials ≥3 weeks that reported data for systolic, diastolic, and/or mean arterial BPs were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias of included studies. Effect estimates were pooled using random effects models, and reported as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed (χ(2) test) and quantified (I(2)). RESULTS: Eight isocaloric trials (n = 554 participants with and without hypertension) were included in the analysis. Dietary pulses, exchanged isocalorically for other foods, significantly lowered systolic (MD = -2.25 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.22 to -0.28), P = 0.03) and mean arterial BP (MD = -0.75 mm Hg (95% CI, -1.44 to -0.06), P = 0.03), and diastolic BP non-significantly (MD = -0.71 mm Hg (95% CI, -1.74 to 0.31), P = 0.17). Heterogeneity was significant for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary pulses significantly lowered BP in people with and without hypertension. Higher-quality large-scale trials are needed to support these findings. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01594567.},

   abstract = {1. Prevention of hypertension and improved blood pressure control can be achieved through dietary modification. In particular, population studies and randomised controlled trials have indicated a beneficial effect of both dietary protein and dietary fibre on level of blood pressure. 2. A large population study indicates that an increase in 37 g/day of protein leads to a decrease in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 3 and 2.5 mmHg, respectively. This protective effect is independent of the source of dietary protein. 3. Meta-analysis suggests that a fibre increase of approximately 17 g/day will decrease systolic blood pressure by 1.15 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 1.65 mmHg, with soluble fibre showing a stronger effect than insoluble fibre. 4. Protein and dietary fibre may have additive effects to lower blood pressure. One feasible approach to increasing both protein and fibre in the daily diet could be through the incorporation of legumes, a protein- and fibre-rich food. 5. This review assesses the evidence for effects of protein and fibre to reduce blood pressure and the potential of incorporation of legumes into the daily diet as a feasible approach to achieving such benefits for blood pressure.},

METHODS: Twenty patients (13 F, 46 ± 11 y) underwent 8 h breath test studies and GI symptom evaluations after standard rice, wheat, or mung bean noodle meals at 8:00 a.m. in a randomized crossover study with a 1-week washout period. The same meal was ingested at 12:00 p.m. RESULTS: The H(2) and CH(4) concentration in the breath samples were similar at baseline (rice:wheat:mung bean, H(2) = 3.6 ± 0.5:4.1 ± 0.5:4.0 ± 0.7 ppm, CH(4) = 1.3 ± 0.3:2.1 ± 0.4:1.9 ± 0.4 ppm, p > 0.05). Beginning at the fifth hour after breakfast, H(2) and CH(4) concentrations significantly increased after wheat compared to rice and mung bean (8 h AUC H(2) = 4120 ± 2622:2267 ± 1780:2356 ± 1722, AUC CH(4) = 1617 ± 1127:946 ± 664:943 ± 584 ppm-min, respectively) (p < 0.05). Bloating and satiety scores significantly increased after wheat compared to rice (p < 0.05), and increased but did not reach statistical significance compared to mung bean (p > 0.05). A higher bloating score after wheat compared to rice and mung bean was observed clearly after lunch but not after breakfast. CONCLUSION: Wheat ingestion produced more intestinal gas and more bloating and satiety scores compared to rice and mung bean, especially after lunch. This provides insight into the role of intestinal gas in the development of bloating symptoms in IBS.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the development of the Oxford WebQ, a web-based 24 h dietary assessment tool developed for repeated administration in large prospective studies; and to report the preliminary assessment of its performance for estimating nutrient intakes. DESIGN: We developed the Oxford WebQ by repeated testing until it was sufficiently comprehensive and easy to use. For the latest version, we compared nutrient intakes from volunteers who completed both the Oxford WebQ and an interviewer-administered 24 h dietary recall on the same day. SETTING: Oxford, UK. SUBJECTS: A total of 116 men and women. RESULTS: The WebQ took a median of 12·5 (interquartile range: 10·8-16·3) min to self-complete and nutrient intakes were estimated automatically. By contrast, the interviewer-administered 24 h dietary recall took 30 min to complete and 30 min to code. Compared with the 24 h dietary recall, the mean Spearman's correlation for the 21 nutrients obtained from the WebQ was 0·6, with the majority between 0·5 and 0·9. The mean differences in intake were less than ±10 % for all nutrients except for carotene and vitamins B12 and D. On rare occasions a food item was reported in only one assessment method, but this was not more frequent or systematically different between the methods. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an interviewer-based 24 h dietary recall, the WebQ captures similar food items and estimates similar nutrient intakes for a single day's dietary intake. The WebQ is self-administered and nutrients are estimated automatically, providing a low-cost method for measuring dietary intake in large-scale studies.},

   journal = {Cereal Chemistry},
   volume = {99},
   number = {1},
   pages = {37-66},
   abstract = {Abstract Background and objectives The market for plant-based meat alternatives experienced unprecedented growth in the past 3 years bolstered by consumer passion for health and wellness, environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and flexitarian lifestyle. The objective of this review is to summarize the appearance, composition, properties, and plant-based food applications of commercially available textured wheat and textured pea proteins including their blends. This review also covers the chronology of events leading to the development of plant-based meat alternatives, the rationale behind consumer adoption of a plant-based diet, and the different methods of texturizing plant proteins to assume the appearance and texture of real meat. Findings The origin of plant-based meat alternatives can be traced back to the time when hydrated wheat gluten (i.e., seitan) and soy-based tofu were first discovered thousands of years ago. A shift toward the consumption of more plant-based foods for both human and planetary health is generating substantial interest from research scientists, food designers, investors, and consumers. More than a dozen texturization technologies for plant proteins have been employed to create the fibrous structure and fleshy appearance of meat alternative products. Textured wheat and pea proteins with appearance and fibrous structure that mimic those of real meat were developed using low-moisture extrusion technology and formulated in meat alternative products with great success. Both textured proteins are available in several forms differing in size, shape, color, and hydration properties. Shapes can vary from crumbles (granules) to chips (flakes) or shreds of different sizes. They contain 59%–79% protein and possess hydration times that decrease with increasing temperature of soaking water with hydration capacities ranging from 1.2 to 4.7 g water absorbed per g of textured protein. Blending of textured wheat protein and textured pea protein improved the in vitro PDCAAS value (0.69–0.74) compared with that of textured wheat protein alone (0.31). Plant-based nuggets, patties, sausages, potstickers, crab cakes, Mexican dishes, and other food products can be successfully formulated that contain either singular or binary mixture of textured protein products to provide texture and nutritional improvements. Conclusions Textured wheat and textured pea proteins including their blends play a significant role in the meat alternative market because they provide resilient meat-like texture, clean flavor profile, a variety of size, shape, and color offerings, ease of formulation, and nutritional benefits (i.e., high protein and no cholesterol). They can be successfully formulated in numerous meat alternative products to provide taste, texture, and nutritional benefits. Significance and novelty This review provides meaningful information on the properties, composition, and food applications of textured wheat and pea proteins including genesis, environmental impact, texturization technologies, and consumer appeal of plant-based meat alternatives. It is projected that meat alternative products will continue to grow driven by increasing consumer demand, the availability of traditional and new plant protein sources, and the application of emerging technologies to transform the plant proteins into a meat-like structure.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The Oxford WebQ is a web-based 24-h dietary assessment method which has been used in UK Biobank and other large prospective studies. The food composition table used to calculate nutrient intakes has recently been replaced with the UK Nutrient Databank, which has food composition data closer in time to when participants completed the questionnaire, and new dietary variables were incorporated. Here we describe the updated version of the Oxford WebQ questionnaire nutrient calculation, and compare nutrient intakes with the previous version used. METHODS: 207,144 UK Biobank participants completed ≥ 1 Oxford WebQs, and means and standard deviations of nutrient intakes were averaged for all completed 24-h dietary assessments. Spearman correlations and weighted kappa statistics were used to compare the re-classification and agreement of nutrient intakes between the two versions. RESULTS: 35 new nutrients were incorporated in the updated version. Compared to the previous version, most nutrients were very similar in the updated version except for a few nutrients which showed a difference of > 10%: lower with the new version for trans-fat (- 20%), and vitamin C (- 15%), but higher for retinol (+ 42%), vitamin D (+ 26%) and vitamin E (+ 20%). Most participants were in the same (> 60%) or adjacent (> 90%) quintile of intake for the two versions. Except for trans-fat (r = 0.58, κ = 0.42), very high correlations were found between the nutrients calculated using the two versions (r > 0.79 and κ > 0.60). CONCLUSION: Small absolute differences in nutrient intakes were observed between the two versions, and the ranking of individuals was minimally affected, except for trans-fat.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Dietary non-oil-seed pulses (chickpeas, beans, peas, lentils, etc.) are a good source of slowly digestible carbohydrate, fibre and vegetable protein and a valuable means of lowering the glycaemic-index (GI) of the diet. To assess the evidence that dietary pulses may benefit glycaemic control, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled experimental trials investigating the effect of pulses, alone or as part of low-GI or high-fibre diets, on markers of glycaemic control in people with and without diabetes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library for relevant controlled trials of >or=7 days. Two independent reviewers (A. Esfahani and J. M. W. Wong) extracted information on study design, participants, treatments and outcomes. Data were pooled using the generic inverse variance method and expressed as standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed by chi (2) and quantified by I (2). Meta-regression models identified independent predictors of effects. RESULTS: A total of 41 trials (39 reports) were included. Pulses alone (11 trials) lowered fasting blood glucose (FBG) (-0.82, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.27) and insulin (-0.49, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.04). Pulses in low-GI diets (19 trials) lowered glycosylated blood proteins (GP), measured as HbA(1c) or fructosamine (-0.28, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.14). Finally, pulses in high-fibre diets (11 trials) lowered FBG (-0.32, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.15) and GP (-0.27, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.09). Inter-study heterogeneity was high and unexplained for most outcomes, with benefits modified or predicted by diabetes status, pulse type, dose, physical form, duration of follow-up, study quality, macronutrient profile of background diets, feeding control and design. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Pooled analyses demonstrated that pulses, alone or in low-GI or high-fibre diets, improve markers of longer term glycaemic control in humans, with the extent of the improvements subject to significant inter-study heterogeneity. There is a need for further large, well-designed trials.},

C57BL/6J mice were fed an HFD with or without VN extract for 16 weeks. VN extract decreased HFD-induced body weight, liver weight, hepatic lipid accumulation, and plasma alanine aminotransferase, and suppressed oxidative stress and inflammation associated with hepatitis. VN extract decreased plasma lipid levels and the expression of lipogenic genes in the livers of HFD-fed mice. VN extract significantly increased phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and expression of fatty acid oxidation genes in the liver of VN-treated HFD mice and HepG2 cells. Further, VN extract inhibited insulin or glucose-stimulated lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, VN extract prevents HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and lipotoxicity through AMPK activation.},

Although the amount of protein may have specific effects, from a broader dietary perspective, the choice of protein sources will inevitably influence other components of diet and may be a critical determinant for the health outcome.To examine the associations of animal and plant protein intake with the risk for mortality.This prospective cohort study of US health care professionals included 131 342 participants from the Nurses’ Health Study (1980 to end of follow-up on June 1, 2012) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986 to end of follow-up on January 31, 2012).

Data were analyzed from June 20, 2014, to January 18, 2016.Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality.Of the 131 342 participants, 85 013 were women (64.7%) and 46 329 were men (35.3%) (mean [SD] age, 49 [9] years). The median protein intake, as assessed by percentage of energy, was 14% for animal protein (5th-95th percentile, 9%-22%) and 4% for plant protein (5th-95th percentile, 2%-6%). After adjusting for major lifestyle and dietary risk factors, animal protein intake was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.02 per 10% energy increment; 95% CI, 0.98-1.05; P for trend = .33) but was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.08 per 10% energy increment; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P for trend = .04). Plant protein was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.90 per 3% energy increment; 95% CI, 0.86-0.95; P for trend < .001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.88 per 3% energy increment; 95% CI, 0.80-0.97; P for trend = .007). These associations were confined to participants with at least 1 unhealthy lifestyle factor based on smoking, heavy alcohol intake, overweight or obesity, and physical inactivity, but not evident among those without any of these risk factors. Replacing animal protein of various origins with plant protein was associated with lower mortality. In particular, the HRs for all-cause mortality were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.59-0.75) when 3% of energy from plant protein was substituted for an equivalent amount of protein from processed red meat, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92) from unprocessed red meat, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75-0.88) from egg.High animal protein intake was positively associated with cardiovascular mortality and high plant protein intake was inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially among individuals with at least 1 lifestyle risk factor. Substitution of plant protein for animal protein, especially that from processed red meat, was associated with lower mortality, suggesting the importance of protein source.},

   abstract = {Objective To analyse the health and environmental implications of adopting national food based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) at a national level and compared with global health and environmental targets.Design Modelling study.Setting 85 countries.Participants Population of 85 countries.Main outcome measures A graded coding method was developed and used to extract quantitative recommendations from 85 FBDGs. The health and environmental impacts of these guidelines were assessed by using a comparative risk assessment of deaths from chronic diseases and a set of country specific environmental footprints for greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater use, cropland use, and fertiliser application. For comparison, the impacts of adopting the global dietary recommendations of the World Health Organization and the EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems were also analysed. Each guideline’s health and sustainability implications were assessed by modelling its adoption at both the national level and globally, and comparing the impacts to global health and environmental targets, including the Action Agenda on Non-Communicable Diseases, the Paris Climate Agreement, the Aichi biodiversity targets related to land use, and the sustainable development goals and planetary boundaries related to freshwater use and fertiliser application.Results Adoption of national FBDGs was associated with reductions in premature mortality of 15% on average (95% uncertainty interval 13% to 16%) and mixed changes in environmental resource demand, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 13% on average (regional range −34% to 35%). When universally adopted globally, most of the national guidelines (83, 98%) were not compatible with at least one of the global health and environmental targets. About a third of the FBDGs (29, 34%) were incompatible with the agenda on non-communicable diseases, and most (57 to 74, 67% to 87%) were incompatible with the Paris Climate Agreement and other environmental targets. In comparison, adoption of the WHO recommendations was associated with similar health and environmental changes, whereas adoption of the EAT-Lancet recommendations was associated with 34% greater reductions in premature mortality, more than three times greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and general attainment of the global health and environmental targets. As an example, the FBDGs of the UK, US, and China were incompatible with the climate change, land use, freshwater, and nitrogen targets, and adopting guidelines in line with the EAT-Lancet recommendation could increase the number of avoided deaths from 78 000 (74 000 to 81 000) to 104 000 (96 000 to 112 000) in the UK, from 480 000 (445 000 to 516 000) to 585 000 (523 000 to 646 000) in the USA, and from 1 149 000 (1 095 000 to 1 204 000) to 1 802 000 (1 664 000 to 1 941 000) in China.Conclusions This analysis suggests that national guidelines could be both healthier and more sustainable. Providing clearer advice on limiting in most contexts the consumption of animal source foods, in particular beef and dairy, was found to have the greatest potential for increasing the environmental sustainability of dietary guidelines, whereas increasing the intake of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and legumes, reducing the intake of red and processed meat, and highlighting the importance of attaining balanced energy intake and weight levels were associated with most of the additional health benefits. The health results were based on observational data and assuming a causal relation between dietary risk factors and health outcomes. The certainty of evidence for these relations is mostly graded as moderate in existing meta-analyses.},

   abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. We estimated the global prevalence, incidence, progression, and outcomes of NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). PubMed/MEDLINE were searched from 1989 to 2015 for terms involving epidemiology and progression of NAFLD. Exclusions included selected groups (studies that exclusively enrolled morbidly obese or diabetics or pediatric) and no data on alcohol consumption or other liver diseases. Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, overall mortality, and liver-related mortality were determined. NASH required histological diagnosis. All studies were reviewed by three independent investigators. Analysis was stratified by region, diagnostic technique, biopsy indication, and study population. We used random-effects models to provide point estimates (95% confidence interval [CI]) of prevalence, incidence, mortality and incidence rate ratios, and metaregression with subgroup analysis to account for heterogeneity. Of 729 studies, 86 were included with a sample size of 8,515,431 from 22 countries. Global prevalence of NAFLD is 25.24% (95% CI: 22.10-28.65) with highest prevalence in the Middle East and South America and lowest in Africa. Metabolic comorbidities associated with NAFLD included obesity (51.34%; 95% CI: 41.38-61.20), type 2 diabetes (22.51%; 95% CI: 17.92-27.89), hyperlipidemia (69.16%; 95% CI: 49.91-83.46%), hypertension (39.34%; 95% CI: 33.15-45.88), and metabolic syndrome (42.54%; 95% CI: 30.06-56.05). Fibrosis progression proportion, and mean annual rate of progression in NASH were 40.76% (95% CI: 34.69-47.13) and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06-0.12). HCC incidence among NAFLD patients was 0.44 per 1,000 person-years (range, 0.29-0.66). Liver-specific mortality and overall mortality among NAFLD and NASH were 0.77 per 1,000 (range, 0.33-1.77) and 11.77 per 1,000 person-years (range, 7.10-19.53) and 15.44 per 1,000 (range, 11.72-20.34) and 25.56 per 1,000 person-years (range, 6.29-103.80). Incidence risk ratios for liver-specific and overall mortality for NAFLD were 1.94 (range, 1.28-2.92) and 1.05 (range, 0.70-1.56). CONCLUSIONS: As the global epidemic of obesity fuels metabolic conditions, the clinical and economic burden of NAFLD will become enormous. (Hepatology 2016;64:73-84).},

   abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are rapidly becoming among the top causes of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and indications for liver transplantation. Other than lifestyle modification through diet and exercise, there are currently no other approved treatments for NASH/NAFLD. Although weight loss can be effective, it is difficult to achieve and sustain. In contrast, bariatric surgery can improve metabolic conditions associated with NAFLD, and has been shown to improve liver histology. To have approved regimens for the treatment of NASH/NAFLD, several issues must be addressed. First, all stakeholders must agree on the most appropriate clinical trial endpoints for NASH. Currently, resolution of NASH (without worsening fibrosis) or reduction of fibrosis stage (without worsening NASH) are the accepted endpoints by the regulatory authorities. It is important to recognize the prognostic implication of histologic features of NASH. In this context, although histologic NASH has been associated with advanced fibrosis, it is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality. In contrast, there are significant data to suggest that fibrosis stage is the only robust and independent predictor of liver-related mortality. In addition to the primary endpoints, several important secondary endpoints, including noninvasive biomarkers, long-term outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes must be considered. In 2018, a few phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of NASH have been initiated. Additionally, a number of phase 2a and 2b clinical trials targeting different pathogenic pathways in NASH are in the pipeline of emerging therapies. CONCLUSION: Over the next 5 years, some of these regimens are expected to provide potential new treatment options for patients with NASH/NAFLD. (Hepatology 2018;68:361-371).},

   abstract = {Background: Emerging evidence suggests that animal protein foods may increase the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We therefore examined the NAFLD risk reduction related to substituting plant protein foods for animal protein foods. Methods: The cohort in North China included 14,541 participants from the Tianjin Chronic Low-Grade Systemic Inflammation and Health (TCLSIH) study, and the cohort in South China included 1297 participants from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study (GNHS). Dietary intake was assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires. NAFLD was ascertained by abdominal ultrasound. The Cox model was used to fit the substitution analysis. Results: In the TCLSIH cohort, when replacing one type of animal protein food (eggs, processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, and fish) with an equivalent serving of plant protein foods (nuts, legumes, and whole grains), the replacement of animal protein foods with whole grains showed the strongest benefit; substituting one serving per day of whole grains for an equal amount of eggs (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79, 1.00), processed meat (HR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.91), unprocessed red meat (HR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.00), poultry (HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.92), or fish (HR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.97) was associated with a lower risk of NAFLD. In both the TCLSIH and GNHS cohorts, replacing poultry with fish, nuts, legumes, or whole grains was associated with a lower risk of NAFLD. When different numbers of protein foods were simultaneously replaced, the risk reduction of NAFLD was stronger. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that replacing animal protein foods with plant protein foods is related to a significant reduction in NAFLD risk.},
