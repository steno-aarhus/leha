*This is a template for writing your protocol in a format that is easily
transferable to the [Open Science Framework registry](https://osf.io/) for all
types of studies. Because this database is not for observational studies per se,
there are fields that are not relevant for you to fill in. These fields have not
been included in this template. Also, all fields where you have to check a list
of items or similar, have also been excluded from this template.*

*Please also refer to a relevant reporting checklist (e.g. STROBE) when
describing the study. Find checklists [here](https://www.equator-network.org/)*

# Study information

## Title

*Put in the title of your study. Remember to include your study design in the title.*

## Description

*Overall description of your project. Think of this as what you would reply if a colleague asked you what your project was about.*

<!-- NOTE: Keep the inline R code below. This inserts the standard UKB statement. -->
`r ukbAid::uk_protocol_statement`

## Objectives and hypotheses 

- *Put in a very brief introduction to the topic. Explain the scientific background and rationale*

- *Put in the research aim/objective*

- *If relevant, list your specific hypotheses*

# Design plan

## Study type

<!-- Note: Leave the below text here. -->

**Observational Study**. Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural experiments, and regression discontinuity designs.

## Blinding

<!-- Note: Leave the below text here. -->

No blinding is involved in this study.

## Study design

<!-- Describe your study design. Typical study designs for observation studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies.

This question has a variety of possible answers. The key is for a researcher to be as detailed as is necessary given the specifics of their design. Be careful to determine if every parameter has been specified in the description of the study design. There may be some overlap between this question and the following questions. That is OK, as long as sufficient detail is given in one of the areas to provide all of the requested information.-->


*put in overall information about the study design. Key elements of the study design, the location, relevant dates, periods of recruitment etc. For instance, include that it is a cohort and cross-sectional (most likely).*

# Sampling plan

## Existing data

<!-- Note: Leave the below text here. -->

**Registration prior to analysis of the data**. As of the date of submission, the data exist and you have accessed it, though no analysis has been conducted related to the research plan (including calculation of summary statistics). A common situation for this scenario when a large dataset exists that is used for many different studies over time, or when a data set is randomly split into a sample for exploratory analyses, and the other section of data is reserved for later confirmatory data analysis.

## Explanation of existing data

<!-- Note: Leave the below text here. -->

The UK Biobank is a large national cohort of participants in the UK, with data collected in a standardized format the the sole purpose of providing a data resource for researchers to use for health research. All information about collection procedures, limitations, and sources of bias are well established and described by the UK Biobank resource.

Because of its size of data collected, it is near impossible to a priori see patterns in the data that might influence how the analysis will be conducted, unless specifically looked for or previously published on. In this way, we feel pre-analysis bias is minimal.

## Data collection procedures

*If relevant, describe if or how the subset of data was selected or chosen participant.*

*Describe how the exposure was assessed (or refer to the UK Biobank link on it)*

*Describe how the outcome was assessed (or refer to the UK Biobank link on it)*

*Describe how the covariates were assessed (or refer to the UK Biobank link on it)*

## Sample size

*Describe the participants. Describe the eligibility criteria and sources of selection of participants. At this point it may not be possible to know your sample size*

## Sample size rationale

*If relevant, describe why you chose the sample size that you did. If using the full dataset, simply say you are using the sample size available in the UK Biobank.*

# Variables

## Measures variables

*list the exposure(s)*

*list the outcome(s)*

*list the covariates*

# Analysis plan

## Statistical models

*Describe your statistical analysis. This is essentially your statistical analysis plan*

*Remember to mention statistical software to be used, analysis of baseline characteristics, adjustment for confounding, selection of potential confounders, examined subgroups, how missing data was handled, how loss to follow-up was addressed and sensitivity analyses* 
## Transformations

*Describe any transformations you will make to the data, such as centering, recoding, etc. This will likely change during the actual analysis, but at least here you can give a general idea for what you will do to the data.*

## Inference criteria

*Describe how you will infer that a result is meaningful or not. For instance, if using p-values, indicate what the threshold is and WHY. Also what steps you are taking to minimize misclassification/false discovery rate.*

## Data exclusion

*Describe what data you will exclude and why. For instance, dropping type 1 diabetes since you are only looking at type 2 diabetes. Or how you will handle outliers.*

## Missing data

*Describe how you will handle missing or incomplete data. This will likely change when you actually do your analysis, but its a good first step.*

## Exploratory analyses (optional)

*Describe any exploratory analyses you will do and that you might report on/include in the manuscript. Exploratory analysis is on where you have not made a hypothesis or prediction about, and instead are seeing what patterns or associations might exist. This could be to help you in your main analysis or it could be the main aim of your project.*
