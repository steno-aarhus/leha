# Installing and setting up the project 

If dependencies have been managed by using `usethis::use_package("packagename")`
through the `DESCRIPTION` file, installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

``` r
remotes::install_deps()
```

Once you've created your dataset using `data-raw/create-data.R`, you can uncomment
the lines in the `_targets.R` file and afterwards run this code whenever you 
enter the RAP project.

``` r
targets::tar_make()
```

- `data/`: Will contain the UK Biobank data (not saved to Git) as well as the
intermediate results output files.
